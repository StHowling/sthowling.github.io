<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a member of Prof. [Yi Ding](https://y-ding.github.io/)'s STYLE group. I became a PhD student at Purdue University in August 2024. 

I obtained my Master's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in March 2024, advised by Prof. [Xiaofeng Gao](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/); and my Bachelor's degree of Computer Science also at SJTU in 2021, co-advised by Prof. Xiaofeng Gao and Prof., IEEE Fellow [Guihai Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=180).

My research interest focuses on **Suistainability of Computing**, e.g., Energy- and Carbon-Efficient Data Center Operation and LLM Serving. I used to work on Data Mining and Recommender Systems during my Master's and Bachelor's study, and led a project aimed at optimizing system efficiency of public cloud computing platforms.
