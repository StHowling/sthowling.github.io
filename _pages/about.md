<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a member of Prof. [Yi Ding](https://y-ding.github.io/)'s STYLE group. I became a PhD student at Purdue University in August 2024. 

I obtained my Master's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in March 2024, advised by Prof. [Xiaofeng Gao](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~gao-xf/); and my Bachelor's degree of Computer Science also at SJTU in 2021, co-advised by Prof. Xiaofeng Gao and Prof., IEEE Fellow [Guihai Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=180).

My research interest focuses on **Suistainability of Computing**, e.g., Energy- and Carbon-Efficient Data Center Operation and LLM Serving. I used to work on Data Mining and Recommender Systems during my Master's and Bachelor's study. Two representative projects aimed at optimizing system efficiency and business operation of public cloud computing platforms.
